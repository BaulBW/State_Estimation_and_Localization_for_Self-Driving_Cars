Course projects from Coursera course: State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars.

The final project is about vehicle localization with error-state extended Kalman filter, where I estimated the trajectory of the vehicle with data from inertial sensors, GNSS and lidar and compared it with the ground truth trajectory.
